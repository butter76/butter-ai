# Love Letter

Love Letter is a card game of risk, deduction, and courtship for 2 players. The goal is to get your love letter into the hands of the Princess while eliminating your opponent.

## Setup
- Shuffle the 16-card deck.
- Remove the top card face-down (set aside without looking).
- Deal one card to each player that is private to them. Throughout the game, players will have exactly one private card.

## Gameplay
- Players take turns, starting with the first player. On your turn:
- Draw one card from the deck.
- Choose one of your two cards to play, discarding it and resolving its effect.

## Card Effects
- Guard (5 cards): Has the number 1 on it. Guess an opponent's card (i.e. any number from 2 to 8, which excludes the Guard). If correct, your opponent loses, and you win!
- Priest (2 cards): Has the number 2 on it. Reveal the opponent's card.
- Baron (2 cards): Has the number 3 on it. Compare hands with opponent. Lower value loses. A tie results in no-effect and both players keep their cards.
- Handmaid (2 cards): Has the number 4 on it. Protect yourself until your next turn. This causes cards 1, 2, 3, and 6 to have no effect. Additionally, card 5 cannot target you, thereby forcing them to target themselves.
- Prince (2 cards): Has then number 5 on it. Force a player (including yourself) to discard their hand and draw a new card. The discarded card does not play its effect. This is the only card where you can specify a player target. If there is no more cards to draw, then you draw the 16th card that was set aside at the start.
- King (1 card): Has the number 6 on it. Trade cards with your opponent.
- Countess (1 card): Has the number 7 on it. Must play the Countess if you also have King or Prince.
- Princess (1 card): Has the number 8 on it. Lose if you discard this card (including by the Prince).

## Round End
A round ends when:
If at the end of a player's turn the deck is empty, or the game ends due to a successful Guard or Baron action.
If the game doesn't end early (due to a Baron, Guard, Princess, or illegal move), the player with the highest-value card wins. If there is a tie, then the player who went second wins.
There are no ties and only one player can win.

## Game Log Format
The game log should be formatted as follows:

- The first lines of the game log should be the description of the game:

```
|game|AlphaLakeGlobal-Game-1
|timestamp|2025-01-05T20:29:11Z
|player|p1|jimmy allen
|player|p2|Jane Doe342
|gamestart
...
```

On every draw action, write that to the log, with the 'hidden' tag:

```
...
|gamestart
|p1|hidden|draw|2
|p2|hidden|draw|3
...
```

Write every turn change to the log as well:

```
...
|turn|p1
...
```

When it is time to for a player to make a move, write the following to the log:
```
|yourturn|p1
```


Every play action should be written as the following:

```
|p1|play|4
```


In total, a full turn might look like this:
```
|turn|p1
|p1|hidden|draw|4
|yourturn|p1
|p1|play|4
```


For the Prince (5), the player should be able to specify a player target as well. This will also cause a discard and draw action to be written to the log.

```
|p1|play|5|p2
|p2|discard|3
|p2|hidden|draw|4
```

For the Guard (1), the player should be able to specify a number between 2 and 8:
```
|p1|play|1|4
```
If the player has no valid target, no number should be specified:
```
|p1|play|1
```

For the King (6), there will be a special log entry for the card swap (assuming p2 who holds a 3 played the 6 on p1 who holds a 4):
```
|swap|p2|p1|3|4
```


For the Priest (2), add a special log entry for the reveal (assuming p2 played the 2 on p1):
```
|p1|reveal|3
```

The game may end after a play action. For example, after a Guard, Baron, or Princess. In this case, the log should end with the following (if p1 won):

By Baron:
```
|lose|p2|baron
|end|p1|win
```

```
|lose|p2|guard
|end|p1|win
```

```
|lose|p2|princess
|end|p1|win
```

If the game ends by highest card, the log should end with:

```
|nodraw
|lose|p2|highest
|end|p1|win
```

|yourmove|p1
|p1|play|5|p1
|p1|discard|8
|lose|p1|princess
|end|p2|win
```

## Bot Format
Bots should take in the current game log (excluding hidden information that only the opponent has) as well as the time left and return a valid action using the following syntax:

```
move <time>
<log>

```

Bots should read from stdin and write to stdout. A bot should reply with the card to be played followed by a target ('p1' or 'p2') if a 5, or a number between 2 and 8 if a 1 and the opponent is unprotected. Both a " " and "|" are valid separators between the card and the target.

If a bot fails to respond within the time limit or returns an invalid action, the bot will lose. In this case, write a special log entry to the log:

```
|lose|p1|timeout
```

```
|lose|p1|invalid
```
