# Project Instructions

Use the project specification and guidelines as you build the app.

Write the complete code for every step. Do not get lazy.

Your goal is to completely finish whatever I ask for.

## Overview

This is python + Yarn monorepo that combines both Typed Python & Typescript. There are multiple projects in this repo located in its own folder in `projects/`, which may use code from `projects/common`. The `projects/common` folder is a library of code that can be used by any project.

Each project is an AI project that researches a particular 2-player game to develop superhuman AI. Each project may have multiple orthogonal Machine Learning techniques to play the game. Each project also has an engine, tourney, and/or UI code, as well as a series of bots that use different techniques to play the game.

## Tech Stack

It is a requirement to use exactly these versions of the following tools:

- Python 3.11
- Yarn 1.22

Python is aliased to `python3.11`. When using `pip`, use the syntax of `python3.11 -m pip`.

## Project Structure

### General Structure

- `projects` - Projects
  - `love-letter` - Love Letter project
    - `bots` - Bots that play the game
    - `config` - Contains .yaml files for the project
    - `gpt` - A GPT-based approach to playing the game
      - `checkpoints` - Checkpoints for the GPT model
      - `models` - GPT model for the project
      - `tests` - Tests for the GPT model
    - `ts` - Typescript code for the project
      - `engine` - Engine for the Love Letter game
      - `tourney` - Tourney code for Love Letter
    - `utils` - Utils for the project
    - `.rules` - Game rules for love letter
    - `package.json` - Yarn package.json for the project, also includes scripts for the project
  - `common` - common code for the project, which can be used by any project


## Rules

Follow these rules when building the project.

### General Rules

Assume all python code is running from `projects/<project-name>`.
- When importing from the `common` folder, use `common.<file>`
- When importing from the current project (i.e.`projects/<project-name>/<module>`), use `<module>.<file>`.

### Python Rules

When working with python code, follow these rules. Always use `python3.11` to run python code. In particular, typing works differently in 3.11 than in previous versions of python, for example X | Y for types.

Python code should be reasonably typed. All functions should have type annotations.


### Pytorch Rules

When using Pytorch, follow these rules. All intermediate tensors should have a comment next to them that specifies the shape of that tensor.

```python
padding_mask = (x != pad_token_id).float()  # [batch_size, seq_len]
padding_mask = padding_mask.unsqueeze(-1)   # [batch_size, seq_len, 1]
```

In general, you should expect to have all models to use a modestly sized batch_size when possible.

All checkpoints should be saved with at least the following keys:

- `model_state_dict` - the model state dict
- `optimizer_state_dict` - the optimizer state dict
- `epoch` - the epoch number
- `model_config` - the model config

When loading a checkpoint, it is essential to load the model config from the checkpoint to initialize the model. This is because the model config may have changed since the checkpoint was saved and the number of layers or other important parameters may have changed.

```python
# Load checkpoint
checkpoint = torch.load(generation_config['checkpoint_path'])

# Initialize model
model = LoveLetterTransformer(
  vocab_size=tokenizer.vocab_size,
  model_config=checkpoint['model_config'],
).to(device)
model.load_state_dict(checkpoint['model_state_dict'])
print(f"Loaded model from checkpoint: {generation_config['checkpoint_path']}")
```

### Config Rules

Generally speaking all classes or functions with configuration should be split up into 1) defaults, 2) .yaml files, 3) command lines arguments. Command line arguments should have highest priority, followed by .yaml files, followed by defaults.

In Python, fully specify the type of the configuration object. An example is:

```python
class ModelConfig(TypedDict):
	d_model: int
	nhead: int
	num_layers: int
	seq_length: int
	dropout: float
	device: str

class DataConfig(TypedDict):
	data_dir: str
	train_split: float
	val_split: float
	type: Literal['mixed', 'pov', 'full']
	max_logs: int | None

class Config(TypedDict):
	model: ModelConfig
	data: DataConfig
```

with a corresponding .yaml file that might look like:

```yaml
model:
  d_model: 128
  nhead: 16
  num_layers: 4
  seq_length: 256
  dropout: 0.1
  device: cuda

data:
  data_dir: "./logs"
  train_split: 0.95
  val_split: 0.05
  type: mixed
```
